= Developing your first application

NOTE: Before we begin make sure to read section on link:../getting-started/system_requirements.adoc[System Requirements]

In this example we build a simple restful HTTP endpoint using WildFly Swarm.
The project uses maven and follows a typical maven project layout:

[source,bash]
----
|-pom.xml
|-src
  |-main
    |-java
----

As a first step, we look at the link:maven_pom.html[Maven POM]

== Generating a custom project

The most simple way to get going is to use the web based link:https://thorntail.io/generator[Project Generator].
It allows you to generate zip file with a full maven build structure, including example application code:

* Head over to the link:https://thorntail.io/generator[Project Generator]
* Chose a `JAX-RS` fraction to begin with
* Click `Generate` and save the resulting zip file on your machine
* Unpack the zip and you've code everything we use in this simple example
